# dcsctp4j
The sctp4j project creates a JNI wrapper around the dcsctp library from libWebRTC.

## Building with Java changes only

To avoid having to build all native libraries,
execute `resources/fetch-maven.sh` to download and extract the native binaries
from the latest release on the Jitsi Maven Repository.

## Building the native libraries
The JNI lib will need to be rebuilt if there is a change in the WebRTC version or a change in the JNI wrapper
C++ files.

### A note on WebRTC
Because the checked-out Google source repositories are large, the build scripts provide an option to use
already checked-out versions of DepotTools and WebRTC.  Pass the path name of the these checkouts to the
build scripts; the DepotTools repository will be updated to the latest version, and the WebRTC repository
to the version specified in `resources/WebRTC-revision.txt`.

* Check out WebRTC and build the libraries (adjusting the paths to DepotTools and WebRTC as desired)
```
$ resources/ubuntu-build-all.sh ~/DepotTools ~/WebRTC
```
